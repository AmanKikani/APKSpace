# Friday
## Project Description
This folder is apart of my "Friday" Project where I attempt to make a virtual assistant while adding back the basic features which are commonly removed from models. This virutal assistant is made to have a better and more refreshing memory than current models or easy to access models. Another one of the major upgrades in this assitant is the use of multiple models for differnt tasks. Each time the assitant is queried, the programd decided which function, system, or model would be best for that application.
### Notes:
This application was built mainly for macs but the only part which is system specific is the opening of applications and the requirement of Alfred or an Alfred alterative.
